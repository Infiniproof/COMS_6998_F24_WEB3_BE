To prove that 3 is an odd number, we need to show that it cannot be evenly divided by 2.

A number is defined as **odd** if it cannot be written in the form \( 2k \), where \( k \) is an integer.

Now, let's try to express 3 as \( 2k \):

- If \( 3 = 2k \), then solving for \( k \) gives \( k = \frac{3}{2} \).

Since \( k \) is not an integer, we see that 3 cannot be written as \( 2k \).

Therefore, 3 is not divisible by 2, and thus, it is an **odd number**.
